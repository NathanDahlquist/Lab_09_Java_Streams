Be the change that you wish to see in the world.
Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.
So many books, so little time.
Either you run the day or the day runs you.
Turn your wounds into wisdom.
Death is being alive and not knowing it.
You miss 100% of the shots you donâ€™t take.
It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation.
